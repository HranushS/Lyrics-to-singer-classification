ԱՐԹՈՒՐ ՄԵՍՉՅԱՆ,ԱՀԱ ԵՎ ՎԵՐՋ,"Here is an end

End of paragraphs and lasting

As a last closed page

And no return already

Oh native bugs

You my last Last Prayer

Suburbs of prison psyche

Chain and solo

Here. And the end

In the heart of a powerless cry

Oh unfinished my song

You my last capital

Now we believe

Where is the Spirit's Church?

We won the war

But it turns out that we lost

Here. And the end

Tell me a voice from the depth

Is the mask of the mask now speaks

Which puppet is the crowd?

The song is the arrow of freedom

And the spear of myth

Bel Joschin Hayk won

Or the opposite of probably

And the pages close the myth tired

Stone Statue History Forgotten

There is no start and finish for this eternal struggle

Your Type of Elimination is delivered to Bell

Here. And the end

Hayk lost to Bell

Here. And the end

I lost in a terrible battle

The song was hit by my unfinished

But why not end

Oh native bugs

You my last Last Prayer

Printed Hoku suburbs

Chain and solo

Here. And the end

In the heart of a powerless cry

Oh unfinished my song

You my last capital

Now we believe

Where is the Spirit's Church?

We won the war

But it turns out that we lost

And the pages close the myth tired

Stone Statue History Forgotten

There is no start and finish for this eternal struggle

The abolished type is losing Bell

Here. And the end

Hayk lost to Bell"

And the prayer of golden tabernacles

All you and the silver flashlight of the monasteries

Khocks woven in diamond



You take you and glorious receivers

And the magician calls of holiday

All of you to leave me only

Father for Hell



And leave me only the chapel in my faith

Take part in the treasures of this world

All you and leave me memories

And the pages of my life woven from nerves



And leave me the fairy tales

And the ways woven from scams

And if I don't suddenly with the light

Weren't all prayers in vain



All will give you the advice counsel priceless

Clasp the glory of your life

And leave me my friends' hearts honest

And the crazy days given in the element



Thus torn branch like a tree of life

We were lost in this world

And on the shoulders only the burden of faith

And the sins of the ungodly century



And leave me the fairy tales

And the ways woven from scams

And if I don't suddenly with the light

Weren't all prayers in vain"

Become your own city

And seek out the door to them

Whose long have you lost



Seated

They have found

There are no words we drink silently

It's too late to late



When like a prodigal son

Back to your home

Smoothing depending on a window

Swing Shadows in the corner



When your father put your shoulder

His trembling hands

Will only be willing to slowly

It's too late to late



In a thousand foreign eyes

Find his gaze

Whoever he loved you

Waiting for your return



When like a prodigal son

Returns love

You hear a short answer

Hey is late



And to whom in which life is

Everything has its own return

I always find it late

Whatever you have lost a long ago

How much suffering God my four disc

Every sea blowing from the fields of life

He will take sighing and grief



Innocent victims of blood boilers

The land will always be wet under my feet

And new judgments around me and far away

People are born with blood drunk



Will become a spoil and famine

Bright babies like light

And the foot of the foot is countless

Worker's sweat anointed



I'm how I sit on a picnic table

And drink happy enjoyment wine

Whenever people will be a haven

The raft of the mouth of the mouth of the bread

Born in Herastor Tours

Meaning has even been meaningless

It doesn't have a runner

Reasons for the Probability without reason

It's been a break on the shores of salvation again

Ghushbas Ando and others



Or the man of the light appeared

That news would spread that news immediately

And who was stealing a light

Should his door be solid



There were endless disputes in the yard

There were reconciliation in the yard

There were suspicious in the yard

Still unchecked gossip



The yard had funny

And odd stories

If I am listing them

Can the song be driven?



Or do you get bored with this song?

How we were in the early survival
How we used to live alone
Living alone with hope
No light without gas
Without water without bread

How we were dreaming about everything
How we missed the ET everything
How we were waiting for water to come
We were waiting
Like a boy to wait for my favorite girl

That the light would also give et

ET queues were so long
That I remember me seem to be so far

Disappointed with the land

And Et Peder I loaded a house
We chicked in the Pree We Well Heated
How can I forget the pots of Dukhovk?
That every morning I felt the odor of the ET
How we were dividing Snikers into five parts
And as the smallest piece of the smaller grew me
And the sense of ET was the only occupation of etes
That the full Armenian lungs saved
The padiesds were dark in the dark
We were pregnant for us.
Alone hand fanes or the light of candle
What I have learned in my life
I studied at the ET Light
I painted in the light of the ET light
I have read below the ET Light
I played in Kurepa early
I remember my friend my advance business
Opening a push fashion premature
Selling a chewing chewing for five drams
But there is a man with that now it's rich
I remember in the locomotor
How we were a boiling water or put a bottle
Which places will warmly warm up
That morning we don't get out of the cold of a blanket
I remember people dependent on the back of Tralebus
In the bus-hugged people in the bus
I remember in the subways when the light was going
The middle of the tunnels were silent in the wagons

Can I love blind eyes
But I have loved one with all my soul and heart
But a single little ie the opinion of EDA night
Really, but he learned my mind from Urd
The night knows at night I will feel at night everything will be clarified
That the finger of one's finger is fucking I know the night cruelty
I will even reject me but the other night me
Will understand necessarily

Even the evil wolf smacks you sweetie with your heck

Warm and good with your smile you do your first step
 Irika will look at a multiculous love that sleeps immediately

Until you don't know for sure we can breathe freely

Myself cheats and waiting
Oh is hard me when you don't
I am who I
My dream again would you kiss me again
And you gladly illuminated my soul
I woke up to sleep again
You silently left my heart bitterly silent
You forgot me my light without you fading now
 Patchy
Tell my heart
That you do not wait for me to email
That I will forget not to ignite
That you left me rather than me
Tell my heart
Let me not be blamed for not guilty
You took me out of your heart
And I ask you only now
Tell me to my heart that you are at least loved
 I am picking up strength and breathing
My heart doesn't want to live in some way
At the sea I'm still swimming in the sea
I'm drowning without you
Oh I'm crazy I miss
I don't know how but I forgive you
I beg you to treat you from this pain
You left me I'm cheated now
You hurt me my heart always filled my eyes wet

Running to where we do not decide

We are a ghost of fragmented apart

We are enough to leave the distance from afar

One day I woke up realized that I should be kind

I have to love Texuz Evil regardless of

And everyone said what Ezav I was crazy

Now I'm sitting on the stone I'm waiting for Jaris

If yours gives a lot to the other hand

Let's lie and you please my other

You don't have to love love you believe in the sky of our kind

And it will believe that it will come when the bar will win the evil"
